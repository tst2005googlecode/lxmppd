[Prosody](http://prosody.im/) (formerly lxmppd) is a new lightweight XMPP server, written entirely in Lua, using common libraries/modules where necessary.

It aims to be small, fast, light on resources, and easy to get running.

Releases are available for [download](http://prosody.im/download) on the main site.

A separate project exists to host community-driven plugins for Prosody, see [prosody-modules](http://prosody-modules.googlecode.com/).
